**13.1 Informal Resolution.** Before filing a claim, you agree to send us a written Notice ("Notice") to 131 Continental Dr Suite 305 Newark, DE, 19713 US and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days, either party may proceed to arbitration or small claims court. 

**13.2 Binding Arbitration.** **Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,** except that:

- You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify
- Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to prevent infringement of Intellectual Property Rights

**Arbitration Rules:**

- Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules").

- The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.
- The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
- The arbitrator may award any relief that would be available in court, including attorneys' fees and costs if authorized by law.

**Costs:**

- Each party will pay its own arbitration fees, except that if you are a consumer (not a business), we will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 (unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous).

**Location:**

- If you are a consumer, arbitration will take place in the county where you reside. If you are a business, arbitration will take place in Newark, Delaware.

**13.6 Venue.** If arbitration is not required (e.g., you opt out or the dispute is not arbitrable), any legal action arising out of or related to these Terms shall be filed exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Newark, Delaware, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
